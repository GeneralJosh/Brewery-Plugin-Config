# Brewery Plugin Edited config with custom recipes


The somewhat difficult brewing process rewards you with a diversity of Potions, which, through their
effects, create a drunkenness that has never existed in Minecraft before. Learn the art of brewing
through fermenting, distilling and barrel aging on your Minecraft server. Experience how, from spring
water and wheat, through hard work, a cool beer is created. Distill high-proof liquor, which gets that
unique taste after some aging in oak barrels. Celebrate the biggest feasts you can imagine and always
keep the cheerful atmosphere. Fill the taverns with laughter and loud music, while the drunkards scuffle
on the streets.


## Fermenting! 

Place Cauldron over a Fire or other heat source Fill it with water Add Ingredients with a right click Wait a
few minutes while they ferment Fill in glass bottles Use a clock on a cauldron, if you want to know the
time the ingredients have been fermenting. [here](https://imgur.com/94XLcLB)


## Distilling

Some Recipes don't need distilling. Put the bottle with ferment into the brewing stand Put
glowstone dust as filter on top into the brewing stand (The Glowstone will not be consumed) 
Aging Edit A barrel is needed for aging. Starting in 1.14 the Minecraft-Barrel can be
used for aging of a few brews. Simply craft and place the barrel und put the brews inside.
You can also build bigger barrels. They can be built in two ways [here](https://imgur.com/5HFGDi5)

### Small Barrel
Use 8 wooden stairs to build a barrel shape. Place a Sign on the lower right side and write "Barrel" in the upper Line:
Message "Barrel created" should appear. Example > [here](https://imgur.com/zbELYwg)

### Big Barrel 
Use 5 Fences, 16 Wooden stairs, and 18 wood planks to build a barrel shape. Attach a Spigot (Fence) and 
a Sign that has "Barrel" written on the first Line Example > [here](https://imgur.com/tSrVnhE)


## Drinking!

After Drinking, the player will find themselves not being able to speak properly in chat, unable to walk in
a straight like and have minor - extreme nausea depending on how much they drank.
Some effects of being plastered are: Nausea Slurred speech depending on drunkenness Trouble walking Vomiting Minor poison effect
immediately after drinking Over Drinking may cause the player to faint and disconnect Blurred vision
Getting Sober Edit After drinking it takes a while until the alcohol is completely gone. During that time
the alcohol level is steadily decreasing. You can also drink milk, or eat bread to further decrease the
alcohol level.
When logging off extremely drunk, it may happen that, if the player logs back in after a while, he may
find himself at an completely unknown Place in the middle of nowhere But if he logs back in after some
hours or next morning, he will find himself at /home, again If the Alcohol was not of best quality, the
player may face some bad type of hangover (slowness and hunger).
Additionally curing your hangover can be done by eating bread or drinking milk and doing "/brewery
info" to check your drunk status
